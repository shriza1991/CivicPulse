## Highlights

- 🧠 5 AI Agents
- ✅ Stage-0 Evidence Trust Gate
- 📍 Community Clustering
- 📄 Complaint + RTI Generation
- 👤 Human Approval Required
- 🏛 Government Escalation
- ☁️ Google Cloud Run Deployment

Nivaran is an AI-powered civic issue reporting and governance platform that enables citizens to report infrastructure problems while improving government accountability through intelligent workflows.

## Current implementation scope

The currently deployed product is the evidence-to-action intake workflow: image evidence validation, Gemini issue classification, nearby issue clustering, threshold-triggered impact and action-draft generation, human draft approval, and email/PDF escalation. The government case lifecycle, offline sync, notifications, community collaboration, and WhatsApp channel include backend or prototype components but are not all complete end-to-end product journeys.

The canonical production deployment is the Render service backed by Neon PostgreSQL and Upstash Redis. Other Docker, Vercel, and Cloud Run files are development or alternate deployment artifacts.


Instead of generating another ticket number, nivaran helps citizens build evidence that is difficult to ignore.

## At a Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem** | Civic complaints rarely lead to accountable action. |
| **Solution** | AI-powered evidence verification and government-ready escalation. |
| **Built With** | Gemini, Google Maps Platform, Cloud Run, React, FastAPI. |
| **Outcome** | Verified evidence → Community intelligence → Government action. |

# The Problem

Most civic platforms successfully collect complaints but fail to create accountability.

They typically:

- Generate passive ticket numbers.
- Accept low-quality or irrelevant evidence.
- Treat every complaint independently.
- Provide little transparency after submission.
- Offer no structured path for escalation.

As a result, important civic issues disappear into administrative queues instead of becoming actionable public cases.

# The Solution

nivaran transforms a single infrastructure photo into a verified, explainable, government-ready civic case.

![Product Workflow](docs/assets/product-workflow.png)

# Why nivaran?

Most civic platforms focus on **report collection**.

nivaran focuses on **government accountability**.

Instead of asking:

> "How can citizens report problems?"

nivaran asks:

> **"How can verified community evidence drive real government action?"**

The platform combines evidence validation, AI reasoning, community intelligence, human approval, and official escalation into a single workflow.

## System Guarantees

Unlike traditional AI demos, nivaran guarantees:

- No automatic government submissions
- Human approval before every escalation
- Explainable AI reasoning
- Evidence-backed metrics only
- Immutable audit trail
- Transparent community intelligence

Every visible insight inside nivaran can be traced back to verified citizen evidence.


# Local Setup

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Gemini API Key
- SendGrid API Key

## Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

npm install

npm run dev
```

# Access Anywhere

nivaran supports multiple reporting channels that all share the same backend pipeline.

| Channel | Status | Purpose |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Web App | ✅ Primary | Full dashboard: submit, track, approve, escalate |
| WhatsApp | ✅ Available | Fast mobile reporting — photo + location = case filed |
| Mobile App | 🔜 Planned | Native app for iOS and Android |

The web app is the complete experience. WhatsApp is a lightweight reporting channel — citizens can submit evidence without opening a browser. All processing runs through the same backend: Stage-0 Validation → Agent Pipeline → Community Clustering → Accountability Drafts.

**Multiple channels. One backend.**

### Technical Notes

- Current implementation uses **Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox** for development.
- Architecture is provider-agnostic. Migrating to Meta Cloud API requires changing only the adapter helpers in `whatsapp.py`.
- The WhatsApp channel is gated by `WHATSAPP_ENABLED=true` in the environment.

### Upcoming WhatsApp Improvements

The next evolution focuses on making WhatsApp significantly more natural and accessible while keeping the same backend pipeline unchanged. These are planned improvements — **not yet implemented**:

1. **Multilingual conversations** — Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, and other Indian languages
2. **Voice reporting** — send a voice note describing the issue
3. **Repair verification** — send a follow-up photo when the issue is fixed
4. **Smart notifications** — proactive updates when your case advances
5. **Accessibility improvements** — richer formatting for screen readers
